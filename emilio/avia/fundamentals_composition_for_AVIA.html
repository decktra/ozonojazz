    <p class="p5"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>The paper analyses
            briefly the development of visual music and a selection of
            music elements in their compositional use in order to
            establish an identical relationship to the moving visuals
            for the translation of a time structure between the two
            sensory domains. The production of an integrated work of art
            that can be similarly and simultaneously perceived by the
            aural and visual senses is named AVIA, Audiovisual
            Integrated Art, characterized by its close interrelated
            musical/visual equivalences, within the domain of visual
            music. The elements analyzed are time, rhythm, space,
            intensity, pitch and color, indicating the requirements
            necessary in the music composition for its AVIA translation.<span

    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>In the history of the
            confluence of Western music with visuals, a search for
            centuries, there are many examples of works which have
            explicitly tried to create a perceivable link between music
            and a corresponding visual display, whether still or in
            time. The intention to integrate structured sounds with a
            logically resulting image has been a long-standing challenge
            to artists, theorists and entertainers, producing in the
            process many symbolic and personal solutions, theories,
            instruments and devices, entertainment and art.<span
              class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>Accompanied by the
            music video of the MTV revolution since the 1980s, this
            joint art-form known as ‘visual music’ has significantly
            evolved in the last decades by the advancement of
            audiovisual digital technology, consolidating its position
            in both worlds of sound and visual arts. Also known as color
            music, lumina, and intermingling with abstract film,
            audiovisual, multimedia, intermedia and video arts, visual
            music differs from the wide spectrum of audiovisual forms in
            the purposely search for the close connection between the
            music and the moving visuals.<span
              class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>Any audiovisual
            production with rhythmic coincidences between visual and
            sound events may fall short of being visual music, and it
            applies similarly to the case of the common film soundtrack.
            Since both sensory domains function in the same time line,
            there is an implicit basic connection in respect to time
            occurrences and linear rhythms, being the natural and
            obvious relationship existing between all forms of
            expressions using simultaneously sounds and visuals.<span
              class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>In visual music, its
            name and present characteristics give a predominance and
            hierarchy to the music side as the pre-existing entity that
            will be identically visualized in most of its
            time-structural aspects, although the efforts, experimenting
            and technological advancements, as well as the results, are
            all mainly concentrated on the visual side. Music has had
            from its birth the expertise of communication through
            structures in time, and moving visuals is relatively a
            newcomer to this field, specially when dealing with abstract
            elements. The hidden agenda may seem to be, not to simply
            make music and visuals an unity, nor to render a faithful
            visualization of music, but the quest for moving visuals to
            achieve the same expressive power as music enjoys in all its
            abstract conveyance in time. Visual music is basically a
            provisional training station for the moving visuals to
            mature.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>As previously stated,
            the present goal is to produce a narrow interrelation
            between music and moving visuals, as its main defining
            characteristic. However, it is approaching a high degree of
            sophistication by recent software development in which the
            two sides can be digitally locked together, but with the
            risk at the same time of rendering ineffective the different
            perceptual properties intrinsic to each of the two worlds,
            necessary for successful communication. Efforts are
            concentrated in the interfacial connections rather than in
            the global results, since it emerges from the given musical
            structure. In the formal aspects, which are the overall
            direct perceptual entities, moving visuals adopt from music
            its linear rhythmic occurrences, the formal structure of
            parts with contrasts, repetitions, variations and coherence,
            usually differentiated by their textures and resultant
            moods.</big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>The shortcut solution
            in providing a complex time-structure to visuals taken from
            music, however, has an essential problem: although in visual
            music the two sensory domains function simultaneously, and
            may be digitally shared, they are separate fields with
            particular different characteristics and behavior at the
            perceptual level. Their components and how they function and
            can be structured, may not all directly match: certain
            proprietary music constructions are not necessarily
            translatable into the moving-visual arts, nor should it
            seamlessly function in the other way round. The viewer may
            be tempted to try, with little success, to watch the visual
            music with the sound off, in order to expect in the
            imagination anything near to the corresponding music used,
            ruling out of course, any synesthetic experiences.<span
              class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>In the other hand, each
            side can be developed in complexity far more than can be
            expected from the constraint of any matching equivalences,
            and the search for a close inter-connectedness may result in
            the end a hindrance rather than a worthy purpose. Although
            some elements can naturally be shared by both worlds, it is
            expected that the moving-visuals domain will eventually
            develop independently from music, in its own terms.
            Coexistence with music may again come to be in terms of the
            ‘soundtrack’ type, or in complimentary interplay through the
            coincidental aspects as well as separately in their own
            technologies and behaviors, as in the spirit of silent films
            of the late 1920s, such as in the work of Hindemith
            (Schubert, 2007), who also collaborated with Oskar
            Fischinger’s films in the early 1930s. Visual music should
            eventually take out from its name the ‘music’ part and be
            simply called moving-visuals or perhaps visual time-art.
            Some artist are working towards this tendency, such as
            expressed by Paul Friedlander (Friedlander, 2008). For
            fractal and geometrical animations (Gallet, 2007), the
            visual complexities may be unmatchable by any sound
            constructions, as also in Bret Battey’s works (Battey,
            2007), for example. In these cases, the music is set back to
            its soundtrack role. If the visuals are moving regularly,
            just as looking out of the window from the inside of a
            moving train, any music will fit as a background, specially
            if it has strong rhythmic presence. The coincidence with the
            music depends on what point in the z-axis perspective the
            viewer fixes its eye on, and it will always match with the
            timing of the visuals. Another tendency for visual music
            which may be more dependent on the development of the
            rhythmic and physical space connections to music, is in the
            live interaction and performance, and in the video-jockeying
            (vjing).</big></font></big></p>

    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>Within the transient
            life of visual music, the AVIA Translation Project
            (Audiovisual Integrated Art) was started within the Music
            Graduate Program in the Universidad Simón Bolívar, Caracas,
            in September, 2007, in colaboration with the </big><big>ZKM-Zentrum


            für Kunst und Medientechnologie, Karlsruhe, Germany,<b> </b></big><big>in


            order to determine the effective interconnections of time
            structures between what is seen and heard, as a subgroup of
            visual music. The project considers that the development of
            the audiovisual arts will continue to produce many different
            forms and the project maintains that the pursuit of the
            one-art form in itself, the basis of visual music, is no
            longer a justifiable endeavor. The conception of the project
            is to obtain a closer look as to how the links may function
            in order to fine-tune their use for any audiovisual art
            form.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>For this purpose, the
            strategy adopted is to concentrate on the music side. The
            one-way translation, that is, music to moving visuals, was
            preserved. The aspects relevant to the musical-visual
            conversion are being examined in detail, in order to
            elucidate the adequate possibilities to create a work of art
            structured in time that equally functions in both language
            systems: time and rhythm, space, intensity, pitch and color.<span
              class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>First, the music needed
            to be thought in the process of composition within a certain
            restrained frame of possibilities, in terms and purpose of
            its potential for visual translation. It was clear that not
            all music can be translated into visuals, hence, it has to
            be custom-made for it. In each case, a music composition was
            to be created devoid of all the other elements but the one
            or two which would be translated, achieving the time
            structure of the music only through them. Examples can be
            briefly given of two compositions by the author for AVIA
            translation concerning timbre/color (<i>Secretos, </i>see <a
              href="SECRETOS.pdf">Figure 1</a>), and physical space (<i>Susurro,


            </i>see <a href="Susurro.pdf">Figure 2</a>).</big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big><i>Secretos, </i>for
            wind sextet was made specifically to achieve a structured
            music only through the element of instrumental color, that
            is, with no melodic, harmonic, spatial, dynamic, nor
            rhythmic change, as in a true <i>Klangfarbenmelodie </i>(melody


            of sound color), in honor to Schönberg’s <i>Farben, </i>the


            third of his <i>Five Pieces for Orchestra</i>, op. 16 of
            1909 (Jewanski, 2008). The work evolves only through the
            performance of a four note chord (Bb, D, E, A), in an
            interlaced matrix whereby the six different wind instruments
            interchange the notes smoothly so that the chord is always
            sounding with 24-color fluctuations. AVIA is accomplished by
            digitally rendering each sound source on six
            horizontally-distributed locations on the monitor screen, on
            six separate monitors or displayed screens.<span
              class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big><i>Susurro</i> is a
            physical-space composition using white noise from six
            horizontally-distributed locations, and visual distribution
            similarly as the previous piece. No melodic, harmonic, color
            changes, exist, with simple linear rhythmic appearances. The
            musical structuring and the AVIA translation is obtained
            only through sound source location in a straight horizontal,
            front axis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>Fine-tuning in the
            visual rendering may involve changing or adjusting the
            compositions until effectiveness is achieved, and then the
            two will be merged together in a color &amp; space
            composition for visual translation.</big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>Second, a stipulated
            set of parameters were defined for a selection of
            musical/visual elements used in the translation, which are
            in the process of originating new compositions for the AVIA
            translation. These will be outlined below:</big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p4"><big><font face="Calibri"><big><b>The Time-Lines</b></big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>As music and moving
            images are perceived, their time-lines are exactly the same
            as the perceiver’s life time-line, all three chained in real
            time. They may differ, for example, in the case that the
            recorded music and moving-visual are stopped, fast-forwarded
            or slowed down, since the perceiver’s real life-time cannot
            be changed. However, the visuals can be halted in time,
            resulting in a still-image or frame, and this tiny part of
            the whole can be perceived, although disconnected from the
            time-line. In music, this option is not possible since in
            order for it to be heard, it needs to be linked to the
            listener’s time-line: music cannot be perceived, even a
            small part of it, without any sort of time occurring. The
            only exception would be with silence at the halting point,
            since it does not need to be heard in order to be perceived
            as such, and it could work as a “frozen frame of music,” but
            it is a deceivable image since the time counting (the
            perceiver’s and the given music time-lines), goes on in the
            listener’s mind, and this coupled-time perception is still
            taken as music although nothing sounds. In these terms, the
            corresponding absence of sound would be equaled by absence
            of light, that is, darkness. Since the time goes on in the
            perceiver’s mind, silence/darkness coupled-appearances work
            rhythmically in these three chained time-lines. Silence and
            darkness need to exist within a structured context of a
            perceived time-line, if not, they are no music at all.</big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>An important
            achievement in the development of music in our Western
            civilization was the detachment of music from real-time
            existence. Music achieved this detachment in two stages,
            first by the development of graphical notation from the
            Middle Ages onwards, and second by the invention of sound
            recording in the twentieth century. In the
            graphical-notation music analogy, time as such does not
            exist, although it is represented on the x-axis, passing
            from left to right when the observer sets the eyes on the
            paper and starts to read. Time consciousness in this
            representation is completely flexible, personal and
            imaginary, since it will not be “hooked” in real-time to the
            reader’s time-line.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>Nevertheless, this
            graphical representation of time in the x-axis can be
            paralleled in the moving visual images on the screen,
            producing a double time-line: the real-time of the music
            moving images in sync with the perceiver’s time-line in one
            hand, and the time occurring in the visual x-axis from left
            to right, or in any other axis. The graphical representation
            also includes a memory imprint of what has happened.
            Although it may be useful for visually portraying a melody
            in its whole moving contour, as it sounds or as it has
            sounded, we proposed for the AVIA project to discard this
            graphical representation of time for the reasons that music
            has no real memory rendition as it is being perceived at the
            instant called present. It is understood and enjoyed by
            relating what the perceiver is hearing, to what has just
            been heard, expect to hear, or has heard and is able to
            recall from its life’s sound-memories and experiences. The
            visuals in this case would have two time-lines, whereas in
            the music only one. Music as perceived is totally dependent
            on memory and in AVIA moving-visuals, this instant of
            perception has to be matched with no memory imprint on the
            screen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>In the sound recording,
            music functions simultaneously with the perceiver’s
            time-line but can also be independently stopped and heard in
            different variations of time such as faster, slower,
            backwards and even dynamically distorted. These time-line
            changes were never possible in traditional real-time
            live-perception of music up to this technological break. In
            A/V recording and playback, music and visuals are locked
            simultaneously, allowing for any time-distortions and time
            processes.</big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>Another aspect that we
            must consider in the time-line discussion, is the agreement
            on the “instant of perception.” Music is perceived in the
            instant that it is heard, which is additionally, one of the
            narrower descriptions of the “present time.”
            Notwithstanding, music is understood and enjoyed by relating
            what the perceiver is hearing, to what has just been heard,
            expect to hear, or has heard and is able to recall from its
            life’s sound memories and experiences. The perception takes
            place, nonetheless, at the instant usually called present.
            In moving-visuals, an imaginary time-axis can occur created
            by the perspective effect on the screen of an object moving
            in time between two points in any axis, such as a series of
            objects moving and increasing in size from the middle of the
            screen to both sides of it. This may give the illusion of a
            time-line within the real-time perceptional line. It opens
            up an interesting aspect of the unfeasibility of “future
            listening”: if the time of the incidence of music, its
            “instant of present” is coupled to the events when they
            reach the front of the screen, then the events that are
            coming in the future are seen as the small ones appearing
            from the middle, something that cannot happen in music. The
            perceiver may expect things to happen in music, as in the
            case of a sequence that is repeated and it may be expected
            yet another repetition or scaling of the formula to happen,
            but certainly music cannot be heard ahead of its instant!</big></font></big></p>

    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>Visual information is
            part of the communication experience in the musical live
            performance. The customary relation to the perceiver’s
            memory bank, that someone is playing the instrument that is
            heard, may also arise in a performed and recorded sound
            heard through speakers, and a visual performance may be
            induced in the imagination. Even if although sounds are
            loosing their visual-production relationship as more music
            is heard which is not directly produced by human activity,
            the imagination is in turn open to visual freedom, attending
            perhaps to the feelings stimulated by the music.
            Nevertheless, the rhythmic coincidence between sound and
            visual information is grounded in the music-production link
            to the music making process.</big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>The main coupling in
            the visual production with the music perception, apart from
            many subsidiary factors, is that both perceptions occur at
            the same time, that is, their time-appearance structure, or
            rhythm, is exactly identical. Rhythm is present in almost
            everything in our life, and similarly we could say the same
            about time, so naturally, rhythm is by far the main link
            between music and visuals and perhaps the one mostly used
            between the two sensory worlds. The rhythmic relationship
            works in both fields in a sequential occurrence, that is, it
            simply happens in a linear mode. Most of the dance, theatre,
            film and video arts function with this simultaneous
            connection with music. The rhythmic coupling is so strong
            between the musical and visual domains that<span
              class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>rhythms may
            easily be “heard” through a solely visual input, such as a
            dance group or lights turning on and off rhythmically, but
            these perceptions are channeled as if they were a musical
            experience. This takes effect only if the tempo induced in
            the rhythmic structures falls within the "music tempo range"
            (see below). Outside this range, any time structure trough
            whicheve medium, will not be perceived as "music".<br>

    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>Other more complex
            time-structural devices such as grouping, phrase-forming,
            multiple layers, to name a few, which are particular of the
            music rhythmic domain, would have to be explored through
            only-rhythmic compositions for AVIA translation, determining
            whether ‘visual rhythm’ can be perceived from a musical
            standpoint of rhythmic understanding, but without the
            sounds. The AVIA project needs to examine further the visual
            rhythmic potential using, for example, space-marking (as in
            hocket) and brightness- or color-marking (as for accents or
            timbre) to induce grouping perception.</big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>On the other hand, the
            understanding of rhythmic structures through beat-induction
            has a strong association to the physical movement of the
            body, that is to say, musical rhythm is understood by the
            inductive process of beat forming which is movement-related,
            and this, to say the least, must have a visual connection.
            So the art of dance may have solutions here to offer. The
            AVIA group has to the date no compositions for the rhythmic
            translation to moving visuals.</big></font></big></p>

    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>There is a range of
            tempo in which rhythm is musically understood: Any
            pulse-inducing structures which fall between the ±42 – ±182
            bpm beat-spectrum can be perceived as music, even without
            sound. Out of this range, rhythm is not sensed as such and
            must be measured by other non-musical means. There are
            time-ordered events in all of our nature, from the smallest
            cycling electron to the complex-moving planetary system.

            the visual world and we could expect visual group-forming in
            tempi in which music just does not work. In order to relate
            to a faster or slower rhythmic structure happening in
            moving-visuals that fall out of the range of the musical
            rhythmic field, a simple double and half factor can be

    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>In music, two-ear
            perception can allow for the discrimination of the sound
            source location within the real, physical space around the
            listener. However, other imaginary physical spaces can be
            formed from the perceptual and associative processes
            deriving from sound intensity and pitch. In the perception
            of sound intensity, an association to the z-axis can be
            formed as a sound being physically located far or near. In
            the perception of pitch, an association can be formed with
            the y-axis, where a sound can be imaginary located as being
            high or low. For AVIA translation, the imaginary,
            intensity-related, z-axis space relationships are not yet
            included, translating sound intensity as color brilliance,
            but it may be also used as space z-axis relations, in the
            near future through Wave Field Synthesis. The music
            compositions consider only physical space and vertical,
            pitch-related, imaginary, y-axis space. This means that a
            visual should be seen to appear at the same physical
            placement where the sound is heard to come from. This may
            happen in a scaled form, that is, within the smaller size of
            a video screen in&nbsp; scaled representation of a larger
            sound environment, or in true scale dimensions, one-to-one
            visual and sound, with large video screens or
            space-distributed smaller monitors. Because of the
            difference between the visual and musical physical ranges,
            AVIA-translation composition for space must be restrained to
            the limitations of the visual range. Although sound can be
            heard coming from the back of the perceiver’s location, the
            visual matching is impossible since humans are not capable
            of simultaneous 360º vision.</big></font></big></p>

    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>In the initial stage of
            the AVIA project, the pitch translation was approached only
            in relation to the visual y-axis imaginary space. The

            is in the process of being rendered to visual color using
            the Cycling '74's Max 5/Jitter software, adopting and
            testing first the different combining relationships found in
            the existing literature to relate musical timbre to color

            AVIA translation, provides an effective reference tool to
            test the translation possibilities in existence, or develop
            new ones. Nevertheless, preliminary test reconfirmed the
            "...haphazardous nature of the color-pitch analogy."&nbsp;

          </big><big>timbre and color has been expressed in the Western
            arts in many different ways, from the use of words occurring
            similarly in both arts such as “color,” “texture” and
            “chromaticism,” vague descriptions of “bright” or “dark,” to
            complex theories to relate the musical timbres and pitches
            to visual color. Browsing through the development of music
            composition and visual music, it can be easily recognized
            that visual counterparts of music have been more often
            attempted through or associated with color and pitch than
            through the more basic and obvious elements such as rhythm
            and space. </big><big><span class="Apple-converted-space">The

              theoretical link between pitch and color proposed by
              Newton in mid seventeenth century exherted an influence in
              the search through the pitch-color link. He made an
              analogy of the light spectrum divided into its seven
              colors with the distribution of the seven notes in an
              octave, by the fact that octaves of notes and their
              frequencies can be related in proportions of two and
              matched to the color range (van Campen, 2007).</span></big><big>
            This concept triggered the constructions of "color organs"
            (see below) and was followed by a series of treatises at the
            end of the 19th century, influenced by the wave theory, such
            as the works of d'Udine on the correspondence of visual art
            to musical rhythm (Zilczer, 2005). Perhaps the reason for
            this historic preference of pitch-to-color lies also in the
            fact that much of the initial production at the change of
            the twentieth<sup> </sup>century, was performed by artists
            who “suffered” the sensory-perceptive disorder known as
            synesthesia, receiving color images when hearing music.
            Another reason for the main use of color in the visual
            translation of music may lie in the assumption made from its
            historical use, that for a Western ear musical timbre alone
            does not provide the necessary retention of time structures
            in the detail and effectiveness that pitch and rhythmic
            structures do, and in this sense, timbre remains as a
            latent, vague and ambiguous vehicle of expression in our
            culture. The assumption yet to be proved may be a reason to
            explain that color makes it easier to be used for
            loose-matching translations, or as previously quoted, there
            is no real equivalence at all possible. In another field of
            expression, programmatic music, descriptions of colored
            scenery, whether real or imaginary, expanded the link within
            the realm of individual fantasy.<span

            beginning of the twentieth<sup> </sup>century and later,
            may have been impelled by the development of the photography
            and film technology of the times, connected with their
            innate synesthetic aptitudes, or perhaps as another
            language-structure solution to the decaying tonal system
            which triggered composers in the change of the century to
            search for new ways to organize the musical language.
            Musical timbre was one of the main elements in this
            overhaul, adopted by the impressionists, the post-romantic
            composers, as well as by the later serial and electronic
            movements of the 1950s. Music creators such as Skryabin,
            Varèse, Messiaen, Gershwin<big> and </big>Bliss</big> <big>at

            the beginning of the twentieth<sup> </sup>century and
            later, produced works which dealt directly with the
            association of pitch and harmony with visual color
            (Griffiths, 2008). Works such as Skryabin’s <i>Prométhée,
              le poème du feu</i> from 1910, included the <i>Clavier à
              Lumière</i>, an organ with lights, as well as dancers and
            perfumes, (Powell, 2007). Schönberg, although creator of one
            of these language changes with his twelve-tone composition
            method, approached the color translation from a different
            perspective through his concept of <i>Klangfarbenmelodie</i>,
            and a concrete attempt with his <i>Farben </i>composition
            (1909, op. 16). Although not an admitted synesthetic,
            Schönberg as a dual artist was involved in the visual arts
            as an active painter within the Expressionistic movement,
            which was developing into the abstract territory, and draws
            a parallel to the structural possibilities of color
            similarly as to what was happening in atonal music at the
            times. Another important composer-painter to be mentioned
            was Ciurlionis, whose approach was not theoretical but
            through cosmological imagenary (Zilczer, 2005). Thus the
            tendency towards visual music through the use of color
            translation (musical and visual), was in essence a search
            towards abstraction, in both fields simultaneously. There is
            a considerable strong output of works dealing with the </big><big>translation


            of </big><big>music to still-visuals in the hands of
            well-known painters such as Kandinsky, Klee, Mondrian,
            Picabia, Delaunay, as well as significant lesser-known
            artists such as Hartley, </big><big>Valensi</big><big>,
            Kupka, </big><big>Baranoff-Rossiné</big><big>, Russell,
            Macdonald-Wright, Matiushin, </big><big>O'Keeffe and Dove,

            photographic art had the same intentions of music analogy.
            These visual artists were inspired by the abstract nature of

    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>Once in the twentieth
            century, the color music/visual crusade branched into many
            possibilities by the continuously advancement of mechanical,
            electric, electronic and digital devices, innovations in the
            sensory domains such as </big><big>photography and </big><big>film,


            recorded music, television, video, computers, and
            communication networks, which have shaped our lives
            dramatically, and of course, the arts. We have ultimately
            come to be looking at a video screen for work, creation, </big><big>communication,

            socializing </big><big>and entertainment. There has been a
            consistent trend in this century towards multimedia and
            specifically to the audiovisual art forms, gaining intensity
            in the last decade and establishing into the 21st century
            due to the expected development of the needed digital
            technology. In the preliminary computer art movements such
            as the <i>Nove tendencije </i>in the early sixties in
            Zagreb, were linked to music, from which the Op-Art boom of
            the mid 1960s grew, as well as constructive and kinetic art
            from 1968 onwards, and included movement as a concept of the
            perception of its art, specially on the side of the
            onlooker. As an example, the Venezuelan kinetic artist Jesús
            Soto of the <i>Nove tendencije</i>, whose works are brought
            to life in time by the movement of the onlooker passing by,
            was equaled by a composer, Antonio Estévez also from
            Venezuela, since movement involves time and time involves
            music. Estévez had at that time immersed himself in the
            electronic music field and created a work to be heard
            simultaneously at the Soto exhibition in Caracas, 1974, his
            <i>Cromovibrafonía Multiple.</i><span

    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>The twentieth century
            has been specially fruitful in its production towards this
            ancient goal: Important achievements in the film domain with
            the committed intention to present simultaneously a work of
            music in a visual form can include the well-known Disney’s
            two <i>Fantasias</i> (1940, 2000), Kubrick’s <i>2001: A
              Space Odyssey</i> (1968), Fricke’s <i>Baraka</i> (1992).
            Mechanical devices had been invented to attempt the
            musical-visual conversion since Arcimboldo (late 16th
            century), Beltrand Castel (mid 18th century), Kastner y
            Bishop (19th century), Rimington and </big><big>Baranoff-Rossiné</big><big>
            (beginning 20th century). But it is in the first half of the
            20th century that a crop of innovators establish a
            self-standing visual art form in time, parallel but not
            exclusive to the celluloid domain: Fischinger, Greenewalt,
            Klein, Wilfred, László and Bentham, among others. This
            pre-video and pre-computer A/V art-form continues with Lye,
            Hirsh, Smith, Hirschfeld-Mack</big>, <big>Richter, Eggelin,
            Ruttman, </big><big>the Whitney brothers, Brakhage and
            Belson</big> <big>to reach a peak in the drug-induced
            synesthesia of the </big><big>psychedeli</big><big>c
            light-shows of the seventies.<span style="font-weight:
              bold;"> </span>The artificial synesthetic dream</big><big>
            achieved through the use of hallucinant drugs in the hands
            of the music counter-culture from the late 1960s onwards,
            indirectly caused the development of a synesthetic
            entertainment culture of live concerts with bubble and laser
            light-shows, to the MTV video-clip presentation of music
            with an obligatory visual complement. This development has
            expanded<span class="Apple-converted-space"> to become the <span
                style="font-style: italic;">status quo</span> of music
              consumption, as established by the democratization of
              video web-publishing through the website <span
                style="font-style: italic;">YouTube</span> since 2005. <br>

              class="Apple-converted-space">In a retrospective

              "blind" activity, devoid of its visual source-counterpart.</span></big><big><span

              technological development of music objects </span></big><big><span

              class="Apple-converted-space">(records, cassettes, cd',
              mp3), simultaneously to a development in mass
              dissemination of music (radio, TV, satellite
              communication, internet), which up until recently had been
              a "blind" music perception. As explained in the beginning
              of this paper, the visual imagination recreated not only
              the missing performance images, but any creative visual
              imagination to what was being heard. One of the drawbacks
              of electronic music concerts, where no performance-linked
              visual imagination is possible for its absence of visual
              relation to instrumental activity, lies in this "blind"
              perception which demands much imagination from the part
              of&nbsp; the listener and which can be helped by any
              viusual aid such as dance, videos or light shows. The
              music-video link established and provided in a highly
              democratic and effective way (and still free) of the <span
                style="font-style: italic;">YouTube</span> site is a
              logical consequence of re-establishing the natural visual
              counterpart of music, lost for almost a century. In this
              sense, there can never be an electronic music concert
              again without a visual counterpart and we could presume
              that the <span style="font-style: italic;">Zeitgeist</span>
              of audiovisual art expressions is approaching its golden
              age. Recent films such as Disneys/Pixar's <span
                style="font-style: italic;">Wall-E</span> (2008),
              achieves the unity of sound and visual link as a
              construction of an expressive A/V language devoid of words
              and without music but highly effective in identifying an
              image with a sound, process called "sound design" by Ben
              Burtt, Jr.<br>
            </span></big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Calibri"> </font></big>
    <p class="p3"><big><font face="Calibri"><big>Due to its special
            attraction to the senses, visual music has been part of the
            "circus circuit" since the days of the color organs and the
            like, always finding a direct public interested in its
            novelty. Composers such as Varèse</big><big> and Messiaen
            undertook audiovisual productions in world fairs and other
            effective but lighter side-products for entertainment
            include the <span style="font-style: italic;">Son et
              Lumiere</span> complement to famous touristic sites, and
            Rockola's famous line of Rock-Ola Jukeboxes from 1935, which
            carrousel light and sound-derived magic is continued in
            today’s softwares that render a moving image to sounding
            music in the Media Player, iTunes, mirror-balls,
            disco-lights apparel and the exciting fast-upcoming
            video-jockeys. <br>

            overall tendency and as a new art form, in accordance with
            our video-screen age. Its primarily purpose is still pending
            to be achieved, in its new space to create simultaneously
            abstract musical and visual expressions with new tools and,
            eventually, in a new language: an ideal meeting place for
            the two arts to combine and coexist. </big><big>From the
            early color organs to laptops, works by Fischinger to
            videoart, kinetic art to Kraftwerk, the jukeboxes to iTunes,
            disco mirror-balls to video-jockeys, visual music today
            centers and closes the circle of the integration of sounds
            and moving images, it is the arts of our times and the AVIA
            project may perhaps help to learn to know how.</big></font></big></p>
