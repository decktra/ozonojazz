                thirty years ago, we have not seen each other live for
                twenty years now. The existence of emotions of love,
                within many other feelings, attributed to a life solely
                in the domain of the imagination is a key to the reality
                of existence and consciousness.</font><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it strange that I labored over the
            color choice of the paper for this note? Should I go with
            BLUE, in memory of the children’s story you once told me
            where “Mar y Cielo” were repeated in the rhythm of the tale?
            LAVENDER? The shade of the many mornings that I woke to
            wonder if our secret meeting the night prior was but a
            delicious dream for only me to savor? RED, for the chilis
            that captured our spirits so many moons ago?&nbsp; ORANGE
            for my half orange? Ultimately I chose this, the color of
            roots that reached below the surface, reached under us as we
            have shifted and changed with the wind and sun and rain.
            Roots that have stretched for miles, connecting and carrying
            vibrations to other roots that stretch under and through
            valleys and rivers and oceans, connecting us again.<br>
            <br>
            May the contents of this box bring you joy and nourish your
            body and spirit. May they stretch a smile on your face and
            release the rays of wisdom from the corners of your eyes.<br>

            Your absence is <br>
            HEAVY<br>
            I have been carrying it for decades<br>
            Sometimes it settles in my elbows, rendering them motionless<br>
            Other times I balance it on and in my head, calculating each
            movement of my hips and swing of arms as to not upset the
            balance<br>
            yes, the balance<br>
            for if it is balanced,<br>
            the weight of it just pushes me down,<br>
            spares me the indignity of flailing this way and that, <br>
            In grotesque desperation to catch myself before slamming to
            the earth.<br>
            Most times it settles on my heart, <br>
            this absence<br>
            It squeezes with each beat<br>
            A little too hard<br>
            Vacating every last drop from each chamber<br>
            Reminding me of how close<br>
            How close we were<br>
            How close<br>
            How close we were to having<br>
            Having, having it all<br>
            Leaving <br>
            Leaving only the weight<br>

            stop spreading my affection on the outside of the envelopes,
            the packages sent to you in Europe.<br>

            Have the clouds conspired to bring your scent to me?&nbsp;
            Have they stolen the influences of the moon and her pull on
            the waters, the sun in its brilliance to push with its heat,
            to carry your essence?<br>
            To enter me as essential as my breath?<br>
            To stir my longing, <br>

            So good to hear your voice!<br>

            August<br>
            I will make the pilgrimage to the origin of us. <br>
            I danced in the sunlight to the cadence of your drum<br>
            By firelight our eyes were a tango of glances, competing
            with the flames<br>
            As all the world fell away in the absence of our light<br>
            <br>
            You my half orange<br>

            My blood<br>
            <br>
            Did you know it then?&nbsp; Can our hearts defy the shackles
            of linear time?&nbsp; Did the fire and the wine and the
            magic of the night air allow our spirits a portal in time, a
            glimpse of our destiny of passion?<br>
            <br>
            Did Cadence summon us to create her or did our fierce desire
            to revive ourselves summon her?<br>

            Wish you were going with me!<br>

            The knife drawn across flesh<br>
            Reveals the sticky promise of a golden dance on the tongue<br>
            <br>
            A ritual of peeling and tasting, unwitnessed by me until now<br>
            <br>
            We had so few moments of everyday life together though I
            have imagined them.&nbsp; I extrapolate from our stolen
            moments…how you took pleasure in the smallest of
            moments.&nbsp; The feel of a fabric on your skin, the smell
            of a meal, the sound of rain.&nbsp; Were you to ask me to
            imagine you eating a mango, I would have imagined something
            like what you sent.<br>
            <br>
            Were all my other imaginings just as accurate?&nbsp; Were
            they imaginings or did I peek at another trajectory where
            other versions of us lived a&nbsp; life together?<br>
            <br>
            Would we be tired of one another, arguing over who should
            take out the trash? Would we have lost our jobs because we
            stayed home making love all day?<br>
            <br>
            <b>10-08-2022</b><br>
            When time looked lovingly at us, we twisted together in
            intricate patterns and wild tangles of heated breath and
            angles of arms and legs and hips. <br>
            <br>
            The ropes of dreams and exploration drawing in and
            constructing and hardening in place…<br>
            Constricting and binding<br>
            Converting and bending<br>
            Cementing and bleaching<br>
            <br>
            Faded and bound my movements are imperceptible<br>
            <br>
            Picking at the edges<br>
            Lifting a loop<br>
            Loosening another, all the while the length of me is still…<br>
            Still and waiting for the pick, pick, pick to reach their
            threads, waiting for the moment when the whole damn thing
            rips apart, leaving nothing save the dents in our flesh from
            where we shackled ourselves<br>

            Cool air rolls through a cracked window, cascading to the
            floor, curls around ankle, then calf, over the soft bend in
            knee. Climbing, reminding, of our dance in the burning,
            crackling fall of falling into each other’s arms. So brief
            we were, just a few seasons, snuffed out by practicality,
            other commitments, the absurdity of us… the abandon of all
            things proper, cloaked in the purity of skin on skin<br>

            itself transporting us back to a version of us that was
            younger, wilder, and naked, unfettered by the layers of
            social pressures, ”adult” responsibilities, jobs and our
            feeble attempts to be something respectable, worthy, and
            full of honor. All the while our wildness is smothered, all
            but extinguished until our oxygen arrives in a ring of a
            phone, a velvet voice, the sound of a chuckle, a choppy
            connection that liberates your soul, awakens your senses as

            Each a different loss at the core<br>
            <br>
            layers of iridescence smooth the surface<br>
            <br>
            Rolling on our tongues<br>
            <br>
            Gathering mass<br>
            <br>
            Each moment, a glistening complexity submits to the sheen <br>
            <br>
            It’s form defies the origins, the tumbling transformation,
            graceful perfection, the unburdened love that is without
            expectation<br>

            How strange it is to feel this strong connection after so
            many years.&nbsp;I have carried your heart in mine. The
            essence, the distilled and purest measure of us, captured
            and preserved…is it even real? I have wondered over and
            under decades. &nbsp;This curiosity, as though captured and
            preserved, yet somehow moving, growing, imperceptibly, three
            decades pass before it blooms again. Or maybe we are like
            cicadas, evolving in the earth of the earth, waiting to
            emerge with purpose. &nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Do &nbsp;you remember the first night we spoke? You made me
            a drink in someone’s kitchen. &nbsp;We spoke of children who
            only lived but a few hours. &nbsp;Consequential lives that
            shook us, screamed with tiny lungs, to live, to dare us to
            exist with purpose and to love with &nbsp;abandon.<br>
            <br>
            We both knew that night that ours was not a chance meeting.
            We had destiny to fulfill, scalding love to touch, to burn
            with.<br>
            <br>
            Have we cooled enough to appreciate this purity?<br>
            <br>
            (Reply by EM)<br>
            Cicada purity, I am amazed and startled by your written
            conveying of our complex but pure sentiments. Should I write
            a love song with them, or a chorale, or even an opera or
            film script, or perhaps guitar music with contemporary dance
            on video? I am barely and simply transcribing them onto a
            page which I will hang on to my "poems segment" of my web
            page, while I await a creative surge to respond in matching
            profoundness. Even all the art forms, including my own
            grasped abilities to create music, fall short of expressing
            your texts. This deception of the arts renders me
            defenseless, Annette, I remain numb, but
            privileged&nbsp;that I am in it, I am part of it, a selfish
            hedonist of pure love. <br>
            Yours, truly, <br>

              Our Daughter<br>
              <br>
              28 years of breath and art, laughter and sadness- <br>
              Woven into a woman profound<br>
              <br>
              What measures a life? The years that pass? <br>
              The works created? The lovers lost and those we hold
              close?<br>

              What is a life? Is it measured in hearts connected, <br>
              however brief? &nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              This is how I measure- Who did I let in?&nbsp; <br>
              How many can my heart hold?&nbsp; Who did I let tear at my
              insides, leaving me breathless?<br>
              <br>
              The ones I return to, after the pain, carrying my scarred
              body, holding my wounds.<br>
              <br>
              These are the ones. I deem “worth it.”&nbsp; The ones who
              have loved me fiercely, branded my soul, <br>
              screamed at me to savor a moment, even those that push me
              to my knees.<br>
              <br>

                      I have a recurring dream about you.&nbsp; One or
                      both of us is traveling. We are near each other,
                      within a few miles, but somehow never close the
                      gap, to see one another, missing each other by
                      minutes or meters.&nbsp; I wake and I’m jealous of
                      the indifferent people riding across from you on
                      the train from Amsterdam, serving you coffee in a

                      What if we never meet again? <br>

      I had so many dreams of you and Claudio this morning.&nbsp; We
      were at a swimming pool together in Venezuela.&nbsp; I hope you
      are doing ok.&nbsp; Cadence is very upset about Claudio.&nbsp; She
      felt very connected to him.<br>
