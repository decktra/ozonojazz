    <p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Calibri">Virtual
        Violence: Ode to Abu Ghraib is a live concert-installation and a
        music concert at the same time, which expresses in a
        theatretical way, as well as through music symbology, the state
        of violence fed to us by the media and the imprisonment of
        failed communication and isolation in our global&nbsp;
        incommunicated existence. It wants to convey that the violence
        present in our society and the use of it in different forms is
        now being insistently brought into the society’s smaller social
        cell, the family in its living room. This violence is virtual
        and focused to us through the screens of our present life. <br>
      </font> </p>
    <font face="Calibri"> </font>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Calibri">The composition
        presents and criticizes the three most common ways of media
        violence: comics and videogames, films and the news. However, it
        concentrates on the war on terror that is being waged since 9/11
        through the media, where each individual viewer is the potential
        victim and recipient of the terror originating from each side,
        where war is being waged thrugh the media by achieve=ing a
        victory the side that gets more coverage, in seconds (TV,
        radio), millimeters. (printed press) or clicks (internet). Abu
        Ghraib was a media battle which hit very hard the USA, the same
        way but in a smaller scale, as the 9/11 did. Each side wins or
        looses depending on the hierarchy achieved in the news ranking
        and exposure time, lessened by repetitious fatigue, theme
        displacement or oblivion. If no news appear, then the war is
        virtually over since there will be no attention paid to it by
        anyone. The viewer is the ultmimate victim absorbing the rage
        from each side, the violence and the terror to which he/she has
        been exposed to.<br>
      </font> </p>
    <font face="Calibri"> </font>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Calibri">The composition
        represents on stage the common habitat of our urban century: the
        evening of every day, the homely family around the TV set,
        father musician practicing his scales, the mother watching TV
        and the child isolated in his world of carnage in videogames.
        The television, teh eye to the global world, shows three
        customary events of media aggression: TV comics with heavy
        beatings, a “normal” film of violence with death and brutality,
        and the daily news of war and hostility, developing towards an
        emphasis on Iraq and the prison Abu Ghraib. The soprano, the
        symbol of the woman, bearer and creator of life, initiates
        a&nbsp; prayer in fast tempo (in any language), next to the
        sound of the metronome and the guitar scales, the videogame and
        the TV, her chant for peace.</font></p>
    <font face="Calibri"> </font>
    <p><font face="Calibri">The work is constituted of a live
        accumulation of “chained” sound sources,&nbsp; a symbolic music
        prison and hence its name, in the form of three performances of
        fast diatonic scales for the guitar in increasing tempi locked
        in time to the metronome to which the woman orator tries to
        break up rhythmically through her simultaneous fast-chanting or
        rapping. The whole performance is tied to the running TV video
        in three stages (showing the comics, the film and the news), and
        the young boy, although isolated from the rest, is tied to the
        videogame from the beginning until the end, until the mother
        succeeds in untying the “tempo prison”. The interaction between
        the guitar and the soprano is musically challenging because the
        player cannot fall out of the metronome, when the singer is
        trying to pull him/her out of time or sometimes coinciding. The
        resultant mixed-sound environment of scales, metronome,
        chanting, TV and videogames, is also a sound-object of our
        customary acoustic surroundings, where we usually find a TV
        monitor anywhere we go. The performance should start exactly
        seven minutes before the hour so that the third part, the news,
        should actually come from CNN on its 8:00, 9:00 or 10:00pm news
        broadcast. Once the “real” news starts, it will be changed to
        the video news recorded where the Abu Ghraib photos appear. This
        means in terms of time that the whole concert, public and
        musicians are tied to the world media clock, which contributes
        to the notion of our time-imprisonment. <br>
