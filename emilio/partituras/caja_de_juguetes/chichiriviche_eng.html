<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Intrument:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following object is necessary to make the instrument:<br>

<ul>

  <li>a car's ventilador belt</li>
  <li>some plastic fishing thread</li>
  <li>a few empty beer and coke cans, old, rusty, bent, broken or complete.</li>
</ul>

Tie the cans with the thread in various rows hanging from the ventilator belt, similar to a glass chime.<br>

<br>

Equipment:<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  A radio, cd player or recorded sound-producing device, with salsa music or reggaeton music.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<br>
Interpreter:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; A person of about 30-40
years old, with a pot belly. The interpreter is dressed only with a
bading suit or shorts, plastic flip-flops, sun glasses, and a small
straw hat with a feather, or any small hat. The instrument is carried
in the rigth hand, an a liquor/beer bottle half-filled in the left
hand. The interpreter has some sand in his legs and in general bears a
degenerated semblance.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Action: <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; The music of the CD on
stage is turned on very loud. Lights go on, the interpreter enters
slowly onto the stage from the left side, stops in the middle of it,
smiles and produces some sounds with the instrument for 5 seconds. Of
course, nothing is heard because the music is too loud. (The beer-can
instrument should not be amplified). The person then stops for a
moment, looks directly to the audience, takes a drink from the bottle
and leaves the stages through the same side that it was entered. Before
disappearing from the view of the public, he throws the instrument on
the floor, gives it a kick with his foot, and drinks once more from the
bottle.<br>
